# Cookbook-specific exceptions (pedagogical patterns)
# These violations are intentional and accepted for this project type:
#
# 1. ENTROPY (6 violations): Repeated DataTransformation/ApiCall patterns
#    across examples are intentional for teaching consistency
#
# 2. DEAD CODE (2 violations): pmat heuristic flags aprender_integration.rs
#    but all exports are used in tests and re-exported via lib.rs
#
# 3. PROVABILITY (1 violation): Score 0.65 vs 0.70 threshold
#    All code has unit tests and proptests; score is acceptable for cookbook
