## Learning Objectives

- Understand the APR format structure
- Create models programmatically without external frameworks
- Serialize model weights in the APR binary format
- Use deterministic seeds for reproducible model creation

## Prerequisites

```bash
cargo add apr-cookbook
```

No additional features required for basic model creation.
